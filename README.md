# Esp hosted web server

## What does it do?

Right now it just connects to wifi and starts a website on c6super.local address.

## Why does it exist?

Plan is to use this as a base for projects that require website hosting on ESP-IDF

## What will I use it for?

I am hoping to host a simple web chat room or at least a linker for peer 2 peer WebRTC or something. We will see.
